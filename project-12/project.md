## **ANSIBLE REFACTORING AND STATIC ASSIGNMENTS (IMPORTS AND ROLES)**
---

**Code Refactoring**

Refactoring is a general term in computer programming. It means making changes to the source code without changing expected behaviour of the software. The main idea of refactoring is to enhance code readability, increase maintainability and extensibility, reduce complexity, add proper comments without affecting the logic.

## **Step 1 – Jenkins job enhancement**


Before we begin, let us make some changes to our Jenkins job – now every new change in the codes creates a separate directory which is not very convenient when we want to run some commands from one place. Besides, it consumes space on Jenkins serves with each subsequent change. Let us enhance it by introducing a new Jenkins project/job – we will require Copy Artifact plugin.

1. Go to your Jenkins-Ansible server and create a new directory called ansible-config-artifact – we will store there all artifacts after each build.

```
sudo mkdir /home/ec2-user/ansible-config-artifact
```

2. Change permissions to this directory, so Jenkins could save files there – 
**`chmod -R 0777 /home/ec2-user/ansible-config-artifact`**

![create dir and permission](./images/permission-change.png)

3. Go to Jenkins web console -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> on **Available** tab search for **Copy Artifact** and install this plugin without restarting Jenkins

![install copy artifact](./images/jenkins-plugin.png)


4. Create a new Freestyle project (you have done it in Project 9) and name it **save_artifacts**.

![name project](./images/freestyle-project.png)

5. This project will be triggered by completion of your existing **ansible** project. Configure it accordingly:

![build trigger](./images/build-trigger.png)

Note: You can configure number of builds to keep in order to save space on the server, for example, you might want to keep only last 2 or 5 build results. You can also make this change to your ansible job.

6. The main idea of save_artifacts project is to save artifacts into `/home/ec2-user/ansible-config-artifact` directory. To achieve this, create a `Build` step and choose `Copy artifacts from other project,` specify ansible as a source project and `/home/ec2-user/ansible-config-artifact` as a target directory.

![build step](./images/build-steps.png)

7. Test your set up by making some change in README.MD file inside your `ansible-config-mgt` repository (right inside master branch).

If both Jenkins jobs have completed one after another – you shall see your files inside `/home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact` directory and it will be updated with every commit to your master branch.

Now your Jenkins pipeline is more neat and clean.

## **REFACTOR ANSIBLE CODE BY IMPORTING OTHER PLAYBOOKS INTO SITE.YML**

## **Step 2 – Refactor Ansible code by importing other playbooks into site.yml**

Before starting to refactor any codes, ensure that you have pulled down the latest code from master (main) branch, and created a new branch, name it refactor.


1. Within `playbooks` folder, create a new file and name it `site.yml` – This file will now be considered as an entry point into the entire infrastructure configuration. Other playbooks will be included here as a reference. In other words, site.yml will become a parent to all other playbooks that will be developed. Including `common.yml` that you created previously. 

2. Create a new folder in root of the repository and name it `static-assignments`. The **static-assignments** folder is where all other children playbooks will be stored. This is merely for easy organization of your work. It is not an Ansible specific concept, therefore you can choose how you want to organize your work. You will see why the folder name has a prefix of **static** very soon. For now, just follow along.

3. Move `common.yml` file into the newly created `static-assignments` folder.

4. Inside `site.yml` file, import `common.yml` playbook.

```
---
- hosts: all
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml
```

The code above uses built in import_playbook Ansible module.

The folder structure looks like this;

5. Since i need to apply some tasks to your `dev` servers and `wireshark` is already installed – i can go ahead and create another playbook under `static-assignments` and name it `common-del.yml`. In this playbook, configure deletion of `wireshark` utility.

```
---
- name: update web and nfs servers
  hosts: webservers and nfs
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    yum:
      name: wireshark
      state: removed

- name: update LB and DB servers
  hosts: lb, db 
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    apt:
      name: wireshark-qt
      state: absent
      autoremove: yes
      purge: yes
      autoclean: yes
```

update site.yml with - import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common-del.yml instead of common.yml and run it against dev servers:

SSH into the jenkins-ansible server and run the playbook and inventory file

```
ansible-playbook -i /home/ec2-user/ansible-config-artifact/inventory/dev.yml /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact/playbooks/site.yml 
```

![running playbook](./images/delete-wireshark.png)

Make sure that wireshark is deleted on all the servers by running wireshark --version


## **CONFIGURE UAT WEBSERVERS WITH A ROLE ‘WEBSERVER’**

## **Step 3 – Configure UAT Webservers with a role ‘Webserver’**

1. Launch 2 fresh EC2 instances using RHEL 8 image, we will use them as our uat servers, so give them names accordingly – Web1-UAT and Web2-UAT.

![uat servers](./images/uat-server.png)

2. To create a role, you must create a directory called roles/, relative to the playbook file or in /etc/ansible/ directory.

* Create the directory/files structure manually

![directory](./images/file-structure.png)

3. Update your inventory ansible-config-mgt/inventory/uat.yml file with IP addresses of your 2 UAT Web servers

```
[uat-webservers]
<Web1-UAT-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 

<Web2-UAT-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 
```

4. In `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` file uncomment `roles_path` string and provide a full path to your roles directory `roles_path    = /home/ec2-user/ansible-config-artifact/roles`, so Ansible could know where to find configured roles.

5. It is time to start adding some logic to the webserver role. Go into `tasks` directory, and within the `main.yml` file, start writing configuration tasks to do the following:

* Install and configure Apache (`httpd` service)
* Clone Tooling website from GitHub `https://github.com/<your-name>/tooling.git`.
* Ensure the tooling website code is deployed to `/var/www/html` on each of 2 UAT Web servers.
* Make sure httpd service is started

Your main.yml may consist of following tasks:

```
---
- name: Install apache
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: "httpd"
    state: present

- name: Install git
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: "git"
    state: present

- name: clone a repo
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.git:
    repo: https://github.com/Tonybesto/tooling.git
    dest: /var/www/html
    force: yes

- name: copy html content to one level up
  become: true
  command: cp -r /var/www/html /var/www/

- name: Start service httpd, if not started
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: httpd
    state: started

- name: recursively remove /var/www/html directory
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.file:
  path: /var/www/html
  state: absent
```


## **REFERENCE WEBSERVER ROLE**


## **Step 4 – Reference ‘Webserver’ role**


Within the static-assignments folder, create a new assignment for uat-webservers uat-webservers.yml. This is where you will reference the role.

```
---
- hosts: uat-webservers
  roles:
     - webserver
```

Remember that the entry point to our ansible configuration is the `site.yml` file. Therefore, you need to refer your `uat-webservers.yml` role inside `site.yml`.

So, we should have this in `site.yml`

```
---
- hosts: all
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml

- hosts: uat-webservers
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/uat-webservers.yml
```


## **Step 5 – Commit & Test**


Commit your changes, create a Pull Request and merge them to `master` branch, make sure webhook triggered two consequent Jenkins jobs, they ran successfully and copied all the files to your `Jenkins-Ansible` server into `/home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/` directory.

Now run the playbook against your `uat` inventory and see what happens:
```
ansible-playbook -i /home/ec2-user/ansible-config-mgt/inventory/uat.yml /home/ec2-user/ansible-config-mgt/playbooks/site.yaml
```

![run playbook](./images/run-playbook.png)

You should be able to see both of your UAT Web servers configured and you can try to reach them from your browser:

```
http://<Web1-UAT-Server-Public-IP-or-Public-DNS-Name>/index.php

or

http://<Web1-UAT-Server-Public-IP-or-Public-DNS-Name>/index.php
```

Your Ansible architecture now looks like this
